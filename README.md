# Hi, I'm Hien (Emi) Bui ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸŒŸ About Me
Iâ€™m a Data Science M.S. student (Drew, â€™26) who builds practical analytics and ML. Recent work: EV adoption analysis on 235k+ Washington State records, a movie recommender that reaches ~80% accuracy, a desktop YOLO11 detection app (images/video/webcam), and a manga sentiment pipeline (Selenium â†’ NLTK/TextBlob â†’ Tableau/Power BI). Before grad school, I spent 6+ years leading cross functional VFX/animation teamsâ€”experience I now apply to scoping data problems, shipping on time, and communicating results clearly.

Tech: Python (pandas/polars, scikit learn, PyTorch, OpenCV), SQL, R, Plotly, Tableau, Power BI, Git/GitHub.

Interests: Data storytelling, recommender systems, computer vision, and launching small tools that make decisions faster.
